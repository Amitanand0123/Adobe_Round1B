### Methodology: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

Our system is engineered to function as an intelligent document analyst, moving beyond simple keyword searches to deliver nuanced, persona-driven insights from a collection of PDFs. The core methodology is a multi-stage pipeline that deconstructs, comprehends, and ranks document content to find the most relevant information for a specific user and their task.

**Phase 1: Structural Reconstruction**

The process begins with the `PDFProcessor`, which ingests raw PDFs and extracts not just text, but also critical metadata for each text block—font size, style, and precise page coordinates. This granular data feeds into the `HierarchyBuilder`, which reconstructs the document's logical outline. By analyzing typographic cues like font size, boldness, and centrality, the builder identifies potential headings. It then employs a KMeans clustering algorithm on the font sizes of these candidates to programmatically classify them into distinct hierarchical levels (e.g., H1, H2, H3). This allows our system to understand the document's structure even without an explicit table of contents.

**Phase 2: Intelligent Content Chunking**

With the document's hierarchy established, the `AdvancedContentChunker` intelligently associates all text blocks with their corresponding sections. It then segments the content into meaningful, coherent "chunks." This process is guided by heuristics that identify logical breaks, such as large vertical gaps or changes in font style, ensuring that each chunk represents a self-contained idea. Furthermore, it filters out low-value content, like generic phrases or short, non-substantive sentences, by assessing the "content density" of each block, thereby focusing only on substantive information.

**Phase 3: Multi-Faceted Semantic Ranking**

The core of our intelligence lies in the `SemanticRanker`. Instead of relying on a single metric, it calculates a comprehensive relevance score from multiple weighted factors. The primary component is a semantic similarity score, calculated using a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity, which measures the contextual relevance between the user's query and each content chunk.

This semantic score is then blended with several other critical signals:

*   **Persona Alignment:** The score is boosted if a chunk contains terminology specific to the user’s professional role (e.g., "methodology" for a researcher).
*   **Content Specificity:** Actionable content with lists, figures, or numerical data is prioritized.
*   **Section Importance:** Pre-defined rules assign higher value to sections like "Conclusion" or "Results" over introductory material.
*   **Keyword Matching:** Direct keyword matches from the persona and task descriptions provide an additional relevance signal.

By combining structural analysis with this hybrid ranking model, our system delivers a ranked list of sections and subsections that are not just contextually relevant but also tailored to the user's specific needs and perspective, effectively connecting the user with the information that matters most.
